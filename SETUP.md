## 💡 Tips

1. **Start Small**: Get inventory working first, then gardening, then creatures
2. **Test Often**: Use Rojo's hot-reloading to test changes quickly
3. **Use Config**: All balancing is in config files - no code changes needed
4. **Read DEVELOPMENT.md**: Full development workflow guide included
5. **Check Types.lua**: See all data structures defined with types

## 🎮 Architecture Highlights

**Data-Driven Design**
- All game content in config files
- Easy to add new seeds/plants/creatures
- Balance without touching code

**Modular Systems**
- Each system is independent
- Easy to test individually
- Can be developed in parallel

**Server-Authoritative**
- All game logic on server
- Client is display only
- Anti-exploit by design

**Scalable Economy**
- Multiple currency sinks
- Balanced monetization
- F2P-friendly

## 🤝 Ready to Collaborate!
